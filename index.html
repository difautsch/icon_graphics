            <h2> On a Brooklyn stoop in 2007, Denise Brown and her neighbors hatched a plan to save the architectural jewels of Crown Heights. The neighborhood was undergoing gentrification and the recently announced Barclay’s Center would only spur
              more construction catered to the wealthy. Brown and her friends began an exhaustive documentation of the neighborhood with the purpose of petitioning the NYC's preservation commission to spar the neighborhood from overdevelopment
              through historic designation. </h2>

            <p> Landmarking is meant to preserve the story a neighborhood tells about itself. The first wave of landmarking in New York City occurred in the 1970s when the city’s flagship architectural gems like SoHo and Brooklyn Heights became
              official historic districts. The process required activism from the community and it wasn’t until decades later that neighborhoods in the outer boroughs became landmarked. The second wave occurred in the 2000s as the rising cost of
              housing threatened displacement for long-time residents. “In the earlier wave it was more about creating community and in the later phase it was existing communities who wanted to preserve their identity.” according to Emily Goldman, a
              former Preservationist at the L.P.C.

            <p> The Old Methodist Home is a red brick church with stained glass windows built in 1889. Surrounding the building is a jagged parking lot on one side and a grass lot with a basketball court on the other. The Seventh Day Adventist Church
              owns the property and operates the k-8 Hebron School inside the building. Although the property’s grounds are fenced in, local residents are fond of the open space and historic charms of 920 Park Place. </p>
